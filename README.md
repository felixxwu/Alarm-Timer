# Alarm-Timer
An android app that provides a much better interface for setting alarms than the stock app. It uses a large numpad design from which you can set the hours and minutes in one swift input of numbers, inspired by how PayPal inputs pounds and pennies. This is much quicker than setting the hours and minutes individually from a clock face or dropdown list. It features two modes: alarm and timer mode.

## Alarm mode
Inputting "730" would create an alarm for 7:30am.
Inputting "1345" would create an alarm for 13:45pm.

## Timer mode
Inputting "730" would set an alarm 7 hours and 30 minutes from now
Inputting "15" would set an alarm 15 minutes from now
